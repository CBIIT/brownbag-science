# Cell Structure and DNA



## Structure of a Model Cell

## Cell Composition

Cells are made up of

* water
* DNA and RNA (nucleic acids; genetic material)
* proteins (amino acids; enzymes)
* lipids (membrane)
* metabolites (e.g. carbohydrates, ATP, etc)



## Chromosomes

Chromosomes, tightly wound strands of DNA, are located in the nucleus.

## DNA Double Helix and Base Pairs

### DNA vs RNA

RNA is very similar to DNA:

1. has uracil instead of thymine
2. has 3' hydroxyl group on ribose sugar (vs de-oxyribose)
3. usually single stranded (vs double stranded)



## Proteins

Proteins do almost all of the work in the cell, ranging from intracellular receptors, making ATP, and carrying out life-essential functions in the cell.

Proteins are composed of folded strands of amino acids.

## FYI

Human genome

* 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
* ~ 3 billion base pairs
* DNA sequence for any two people is about 99.9% identical
