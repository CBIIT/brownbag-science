# Cells and Cancer



## Cell Growth and a Model for Cancer

Standard model of cell growth involves cells dividing, and creating exact copies of themselves.  Normally, cells are programmed to grow and divide only in certain circumstances. A basic model of cancer involves a cell that continues to grow where normal cells would stop dividing; and a cluster of growing cells develops into a tumor.
