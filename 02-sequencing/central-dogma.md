## Transcription

Strands of RNA can be referred to as "transcripts".   RNA is usually spliced, processed, and modified before it is ready for translation.  

Important!  Several different transcripts can be generated from a single gene.

## Translation

In RNA, units of three nucleotides that encode for amino acids are referred to as codons.

## FYI

* ~2% of mammalian DNA is comprised of exons.
