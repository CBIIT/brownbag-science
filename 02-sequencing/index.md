Notable Sequencing Applications

- pre-natal testing - can sequence mothers blood (fetal dna makes way into mothers bloodstream)

- - jama 2015: 314(2):198

- cancer detection - cancer is shedding dna constantly
- transplant rejection - where transplant has different dna
- detect pathogens - 
- precision medicine for study matching



# Take Home Messages



1. Through chemistry, biochemistry, and understanding molecular biology - we can determine the sequences of our genome
2. There is a lot of work that happens after the Sequencer machine does its work
3. There are different types of sequencing, and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses; (cost, accuracy, time, etc).
4. Sometimes you don't need the entire genome sequence, but rather a targeted subset: maybe just the exons, just the RNA, or a panel of carefully selected genes (oncomine)
5. The "reference assembly" for the human genome was originally based on just a few individuals, and we need to have thousands of individuals to better understand, create a catalogue of common human genetic variation
