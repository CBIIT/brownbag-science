# Medical Genetics

When something goes wrong



## Example

* Chromosome 11
* Nucleotide 5226970 is A, C, or G instead of T
* result: an early termination of gene transcript (not full length)
* occurs in gene for hemoglobin subunit beta; normal protein has two beta and two alpha subunits, and is bound to a heme (the iron-containing molecule) - resulting in low hemoglobin levels a shortage of red blood cells - causing a condition known as [beta thalassemia](https://www.otogenetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Beta-Thalessmia-Sickle-Cell-Disease-Information-Sheet-08-09-2017.pdf) (related to sickle cell anemia)

## Types of Variants (*not* Mutations)

* missense
* nonsense
* silent
* frameshift
* insertion
* deletion
* indel
* splice-site
* duplication
* large structural variants
* copy number
