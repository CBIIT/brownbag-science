# Terminology



The # of base pairs is frequently used as synonym for the # of nucleotides in a single-strand sequence ● This sequence has 5 nucleotides: ACGGT ● We can also say that it has 5 base pairs ● kilo, giga, etc for sequence lengths ● kb → kilo-bases ● Mb → Mega-bases ● Gb → Giga-bases



The full genetic information of an organism ● Contains all chromosomes ● Comprises the coding & non-coding sequence data of the organism ● Coding sequence data → part of the genome that encodes proteins ● Non-coding (in earlier days: junk) DNA → part of the genome that does not encode proteins but still has a function – The function of non-coding DNA is only partially known – Non-coding DNA regulates protein processes 



**Single-Strand DNA**:

**Coding versus non-coding DNA**

* exons: Some parts of the DNA are coding (get turned into protein)

* introns: Some parts are non-coding (think "junk" DNA)

  

**depth of coverage**: a measure of the number of times that a specific genomic site is sequenced during a sequencing run. The more coverage the better

**nucleotide**: 

**base**: a nucleotide

**bp**: base pairs (same as a base)



**sequence lengths:**

* **kb**: kilo-bases, 
* **Mb**: mega-bases
* **Gb**: Giga-bases



**read length**: the number of base pairs that a sequencer "reads". A read length could by anywhere from 50 bp to > 1000s

**read**: a single sequence produced from a sequencer. Think: a sequencing machine read a molecule and this is what it thinks it is.

**library**: a collection of DNA fragments that have been prepared for sequencing. This is generally talking about individual samples.

**run**: an entire sequencing reaction from start to finish.



**NGS**: next-generation sequencing. High-throughput (DNA) sequencing - technologies developed after ~ 2000.





**hg19**: The UCSC assembly of the human genome, version 19; equivalent to GRCh37. 

**hg38**: The UCSC assembly of the human genome, version 38; equivalent GRCh38.

**GRCh37**: Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37; matches with UCSC assembly hg19. Released in February 2009.

**GRCh38**: Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38; matches with UCSC assembly hg38. Released in December 2013.
