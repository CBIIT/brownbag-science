# Genome Size



Genome Size 

* Not necessarily correlated with organism complexity 
* Homo Sapiens: 3.2 Gb (Giga-bases) 
* Marbled lungfish: 130 Gb (Giga-bases) 
* Plants often have very large genomes → partially due to redundant information.



The Human Genome... by the Numbers

* ~5% of Human Genome Sequence is Constrained Across Mammals (and Presumed Functional)
  * 5% of 3B Bases=~150M Bases
  * Do NOT Yet Know the Position of these ~150M Functional Bases
  * Lower Bound for the Amount that is Functional
* ~1.5% Encodes for Protein (Genes)
  * Corresponds to ~18-38K Genes
  * Many More than ~22K Different Proteins
  * GoodInventory at Present
* ~3.5% Functional But Non-Coding
  * Gene Regulatory Elements
  * Chromosomal Functional Elements
  * Undiscovered Functional Elements (NOT Yet in Textbooks!)
  * PoorInventory at Presen



Genome comparisons

* Intra-species sequence comparisons
* Inter-species sequence comparisons
  * all humans are > 99.9% identical (0.1% = 3 million differences, ~ 20,000 differences in genes)
